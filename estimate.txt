1.Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage

In a multi-AZ configuration, in the event of a single AZ failure, 
failover is automatic and the RTO is a few minutes.

2.Minimum RTO for a single region outage

If a single region goes down, you will need to manually fail over.
Because you have a Read Replica in another region, you need to 
promote this instance to a new master before routing traffic 
to the new endpoint. 
RTO takes 30 minutes to 1 hour depending on the recovery through human judgment and operation.


3.Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage

With RDS point-in-time restores that upload transactions every 5 minutes,
 the RPO is about 5 minutes.


4.Minimum RPO for a single region outage

A read replica that aims to keep the primary DB up to date can be achieved
 at about the same level as the primary. RPO is up to about 10 minutes.
